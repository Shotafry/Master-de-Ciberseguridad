00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:33.931
Extraction by Aheradin / Correction by Shotafry

00:01:36.155 --> 00:01:37.572
So Nika...

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:42.059
...has finally emerged.

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:46.439
I can scarcely believe wo Emperors of
the Sea fell at the same time...

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.322
We cannot suppress
knowledge of these events.

00:01:54.323 --> 00:01:57.241
The news will spread
around the world almost instantly.

00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:59.994
The timing could not be any worse!

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:01.954
How do we approach this?

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.582
With respect to Zou...

00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:15.718
Is it true that Zou disappeared?

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:19.680
Yes... Gradually,
into the fog.

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:22.975
But what could that mean...?

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:27.897
That they will not open the borders:

00:02:27.898 --> 00:02:31.817
The Land of Wano
remains an impregnable fortress!

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:35.321
Perhaps they have adapted
their strategies to the situation.

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:37.948
They appear tolbe
under capable leadership.

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:43.663
Then overrunning the country through
force of numbers is impossible.

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:49.335
Is retrieving Nico Robin...

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:51.879
..Still within your ability?

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.672
Absolutely!

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:59.595
CP-o! CP-o!

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:03.265
A jamming signal?

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.769
You guys...

00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:11.357
Identify yourself!

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:14.985
Stay right where you are!

00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:19.865
I’m comin’ to you!

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:30.793
The Land of Wano, freed
from twenty years of tyranny,

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:33.421
celebrates the victory of the Kozuki Clan!

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.727
Drake...

00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:48.769
Are you...

00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:51.480
...a Marine?

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:53.983
You expect me to answer?

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.361
You came here to ask me that?

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.368
You look like you’ve
been to hell and back...

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:13.335
I thought you predicted you’d be safe...

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:16.547
..as long as you didn’t betray Kaido...

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:26.724
When I saw that beast before me,
I knew I was a dead man walking,

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:29.435
and so I became Kaido’s subordinate.

00:04:30.187 --> 00:04:32.188
Kid and Killer, on the other hand,

00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:36.192
continued to resist...

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:41.572
...despite certain death!

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:50.664
Even if I had foreseen their victory...

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:55.377
How could I...

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.840
how could I ever return to Kid
after all this time tail between my legs?

00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:12.645
So you weren’t talking about me...?

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:14.980
That one-percent thing?

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:22.071
Then the fortune you told
for a “certain man” was...

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.247
mine.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.099
So hungry...

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.770
Nay, lam not! Samurai
do not want for food!

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.021
Hey, folks!

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:59.024
Don’t take down the
Fire Festival decorations just yet!

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:02.069
By declaration of Momonosuke-sama—
er, our Lord, the Shogun,

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.238
we are to hold another festival!

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:05.614
Aye!

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:06.574
Yay!

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:12.288
Starting today, I'll
be teaching this class.

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.832
Is Miss Sarahebi gone?!

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:15.958
Whyzzat?

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:21.672
Sorry, but you'll all need
to forget everything she’s taught you.

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:26.302
I will be re-educating you on
the entire history of our heroes!

00:06:26.303 --> 00:06:27.219
Whuuuuuh?!

00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:29.054
We dun wanna!

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.936
Why don’t we start with
a fine fellow, Kozuki Oden?

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:42.818
Shortly after he was born, at the
age of zero, he sent his nanny flying!

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:48.365
Of course, I was surprised!

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:53.871
Komurasaki-sama, the most beautiful woman in
all of Wano, is Oden-sama’s daughter!

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:59.335
And it was the Kawamatsu the Kappa
that saved her from the burning castle!

00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:02.254
What a beautiful story of loyalty!

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:08.427
samurai that protected her by disguising
himse a chivalrous criminal named Kyoshiro...

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:12.556
...Was none other than one
of the Nine Red Scabbards, Denjiro-dono!

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:17.561
Do you know who took down Kaido?

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:20.814
I do! Heard it was a
warrior by the name of “Joyboy”!

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:23.567
Seems like he’s
already left the country...

00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:27.863
I wish I could have seen him! e’s a
hero rivaled only by the God of the Blade!

00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:43.253
Build temples?

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:44.630
Mm-hmm.

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:46.757
As was done for Ryuma,
the God of the Blade,

00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:50.469
I want to build one dedicated to
Oden-sama upon a hill overlooking the Flower Capital!

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:53.263
Surrounding that,

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:55.463
we will build temples
dedicated to Yasuie-dono

00:07:55.487 --> 00:07:57.685
d the other Daimyo that
fought for our country

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:00.604
And...

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:09.029
...for Ashura and Izo as well...

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:27.631
Onimaru!

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:34.138
Onimaru, that tickles!

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:36.056
To think you were alive!

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:40.060
Ah, this brings back memories...

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:43.272
You, too, are a brother-in-arms,
having fought for our country.

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:48.235
I suppose we, too, shall someday be
laid to rest alongside Ashura and Izo.

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:52.573
If that is fine with you, Marco-dono?

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:54.908
Of course, yes sirree.

00:08:56.745 --> 00:08:59.121
One’s home soil is best.

00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:01.707
That’s probably what Izo’d want.

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:09.548
There II go, surviving again...

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.553
As did we...

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:20.476
Had we lived through it all,
only for something to befall our heroes...

00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:23.771
I could not bear the thought.

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:26.482
Let us pray they are well.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.527
So hungry...

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:33.405
Nay, nay, nay...

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.825
Oh, dear brother!

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:38.410
My dear brother!

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:41.246
Yamato-kun, where are you?!

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.249
Luffytaro-san and Zorojuro-san have...!

00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:50.464
Oh, dear brother!
Luffytaro-san and Zorojuro-san have...

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:56.595
awakened!

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:04.520
Ever the tomboy...

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:06.855
It does not hurt though...

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:09.441
Boooooze!

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:12.528
Meeeeat!

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:17.866
Luffy! Zoro!
You have awakened!

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:20.744
Luffy! You are awake!

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:24.581
Good morning, Luffy! Thank
goodness you did wake up!

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:26.917
It’s way too soon for
you to be drinking that much!

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:31.588
Whew, this’s somethin’ to celebrate!

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:34.424
How about we
get this party started?!

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:38.470
Come, now, you two! Do
not eat too much yet!

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:44.101
The whole country was going to have
a grand feast when you woke up!

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:45.352
Let us have it today!

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.406
‘Tis I, Momonosuke!

00:10:57.407 --> 00:10:59.283
Mo-mo-no-suke!

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:02.494
Hwuuuuh?!

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:05.289
Oh, I get it!
You’re all grown up now!

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.749
Your body’s lookin’ pretty strong!

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.251
Because of Oden’s blood, huh?

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:11.545
Lemme try punchin’ ya.

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:12.421
Do not!

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:17.509
They are bullying me!

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:22.097
O-Nami, save me!

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:26.852
Knock that off!

00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:33.692
I-l am still eight years old!

00:11:34.485 --> 00:11:36.069
It does not hurt though...

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.487
Oh, that’s right.

00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:40.365
He’s as tough as I thought...

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:45.662
This is the adult world, Momo!

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:48.457
You cannot hide behind
the privilege of youth anymore!

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:52.836
Here!

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:56.673
Child on the inside,
Oden on the outside!

00:11:56.674 --> 00:11:58.967
Stop putting a tray on my
head every time you see me!

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:04.514
Such a sturdy body! You have
your parents to thank for that!

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:08.810
You will most definitely be
the greatest samurai in our country!

00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:10.395
And I shall persevere at that!

00:12:13.816 --> 00:12:15.150
Mealtime, mealtime!

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.619
Oh yeah, Yamato!

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.748
Let’s hit the baths before the
feast! Your prayers were answered, right?

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:32.167
“Prayers”?

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:37.047
I heard there’s a custom in
Wano where one abstains from doing something...

00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:40.842
...until one’s wish comes true, as
a form of prayer to the gods.

00:12:40.843 --> 00:12:43.762
Until you two recovered,

00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:47.140
I gave up eating and bathing!

00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:49.935
Oh, really?!

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:53.146
Thank you, Yamabro! I’m
all better, thanks to you!

00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:55.148
Whattaguy, eh?

00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:59.278
Neither of us is dirty, though...

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:02.281
I wiped your bodies clean!

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.116
Does it please you?

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.746
Mossbrain!
Let’s talk...

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:13.458
Oh yeah, you...

00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:16.128
But after the battle,

00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:19.840
if l’ve lost my mind...

00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:22.843
you gotta kill me.

00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:26.263
That’s right, I...

00:13:28.057 --> 00:13:32.394
I came back from
hell to kill you!

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:35.147
Uh, yeah,
no, ’msOodnOWw

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.190
It’s all good now...

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:41.320
You can’t be sane
with that dumb-lookin’ face!

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:44.823
What’d you say, asswipe?! I look totally
sane, no matter how ya slice it!

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:46.616
Die with honor, dammit!

00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:48.493
How ‘bout you die, Mossbrain?!

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:50.245
You told me to kill you!

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:51.788
Sheesh...

00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:53.957
Well, let’s go take a bath, then!

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:57.336
Oh, Nami. There’s no
mixed bath in the castle.

00:13:57.337 --> 00:14:01.256
Might I... accompany you, Nami-san?

00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:02.341
Hmm?

00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:12.893
All right, bathtime!

00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:14.269
Yeah!

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.605
Ya-hoo!

00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:25.822
Baths rock!

00:14:25.823 --> 00:14:28.700
What?! A dream?!

00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:33.246
Y-Yamato! You...

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:36.458
Ah, so refreshing!

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:39.628
Being in the bath
together is the best!

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:42.172
We’re gonna party after this!

00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:44.049
It’s gonna be great!

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:50.055
The men’s bath is so noisy!

00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:55.852
I wanna be bewitchin’ just like you!

00:14:56.813 --> 00:14:57.771
Feels good!

00:14:57.772 --> 00:15:02.984
Remember how we all used to
bathe together with Oden-sama and your family?

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:06.780
Though it was quite uncomfortable for
me to bathe with other men...

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:09.157
O-Kiku-chan, you have
not changed one bit!

00:15:09.158 --> 00:15:11.284
And now, I am older than you!

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:14.830
Feels good!

00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:17.332
Shooo goood!

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:20.252
Hey, did you hear?! They
said the feast is today!

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:24.089
Let’s have another celebration! To
the revival of the Kozuki Clan!

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.800
Let all the regions know!

00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:35.350
Managed to get ‘er
back to her old self!

00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:37.853
Yeah, she’s looking seaworthy!

00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:41.606
General Franky’s all fixed up, too!

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:45.068
It’s just so cool!

00:15:46.487 --> 00:15:48.989
No fraternizin’, you morons!

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:52.742
Don’t let your guard down
‘til we’ve left port safely!

00:15:55.663 --> 00:16:00.459
Information must have leaked from
somewhere and reached journalists by now.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.589
And we’re gonna be pegged
as replacement Emperors of the Sea!

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:10.469
He’s right. This is an isolated country,
So people can’t look in from the outside,

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.013
but we can’t see
our enemies’ movements, either.

00:16:13.014 --> 00:16:18.518
Maybe our captains’ bounties have shot up to
mething crazy! Like, higher than any we’ve see

00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:25.942
Got that right! Couldn’t tell
ya how the info leaked, but...

00:16:25.943 --> 00:16:27.235
Apoo!

00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:31.406
You’re the source, gotta be! You
really piss me off, you know that?!

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:36.620
Those bounties you were talkin’
about? I got ‘em, right here!

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:39.956
Wanna see ‘em?

00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:44.377
They’re all there!

00:16:44.378 --> 00:16:46.796
Your new bounties, and...

00:16:46.797 --> 00:16:52.260
...the names of the
soon-to-be-crowned Emperors of the Sea!

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:58.934
I told you to tell me
where the hell you are now!

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:03.522
And I told
you, Sakazuki-san, ’mintheair!

00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:06.691
In the air where?!

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:09.944
Oh, I can see Wano now.

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:14.449
You will not do anything stupid!

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.910
Got that, Green Bull?!

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:22.289
Understood!

00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:24.459
I mean it.

00:17:50.861 --> 00:17:53.488
“Time's up-

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:58.159
someone said again, with a laush

00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:03.123
Fine then, hide-and-seek playtime...

00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:04.874
IS OVeEr

00:18:06.377 --> 00:18:10.255
Lets go, come on

00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:14.050
Let your heart beat out

00:18:14.135 --> 00:18:18.305
and things will chanse

00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:22.309
Grow strong, you have time

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:23.310
Lift up that dream

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:30.358
The overflowing loneliness cant sustain me alone

00:18:30.693 --> 00:18:34.446
We were so free in our younger days

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:37.824
What a dumb dream

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.075
...to live

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:42.996
shining a light on uncharted ways

00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:47.125
Get on our feet and try

00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:51.004
Let's see the ends of the world together

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:54.966
Together, we can so and fly
